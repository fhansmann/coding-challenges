# Coding Challenges
100 code challenges in Python. I commit to trying to solve at least one per day.

#### Question 1:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

## Question 2:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

## Question 3:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

## Question 4:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

## Question 5:
Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

## Question 6:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24

## Question 7:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 

## Question 8:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

## Question 9:
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

## Question 10:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world
