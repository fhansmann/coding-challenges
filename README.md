# Coding Challenges 
### 100 code challenges in Python 
#### I commit to trying to solve at least one per day :v: <br/><br/>

#### Question 1: 
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
<br/>[Answer](c_1.py)

#### Question 2:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
8  
Then, the output should be:  
40320
<br/>[Answer a) with a recursive function](c_2a.py)
<br/>[Answer b) with loop](c_2b.py)

#### Question 3:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
8 . 
Then, the output should be:  
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
<br/>[Answer](c_3.py)

#### Question 4:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
34,67,55,33,12,98   
Then, the output should be:  
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']  
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
<br/>[Answer](c_4.py)

#### Question 5:
Define a class which has at least two methods:  
getString: to get a string from console input  
printString: to print the string in upper case.  
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.
<br/>[Answer](c_5.py)

#### Question 6:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.  
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:  
100,150,180  
The output of the program should be:  
18,22,24
<br/>[Answer](c_6.py)

#### Question 7:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.  
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.
Example  
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:  
3,5  
Then, the output of the program should be:  
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 
<br/>[Answer](c_7.py)

#### Question 8:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:<br/>
without,hello,bag,world<br/>
Then, the output should be:<br/>
bag,hello,without,world
<br/>[Answer](c_8.py)

#### Question 9:
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:<br/>
Hello world<br/>
Practice makes perfect<br/>
Then, the output should be:<br/>
HELLO WORLD<br/>
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
<br/>[Answer](c_9.py)

#### Question 10:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.<br/>
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:<br/>
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again<br/>
Then, the output should be:<br/>
again and hello makes perfect practice world
<br/>[Answer](c_10.py)

#### Question 11:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.<br/>
Example:<br/>
0100,0011,1010,1001<br/>
Then the output should be:<br/>
1010
<br/>[Answer](c_11.py)

#### Question 12:
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.<br/>
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.<br/>

#### Question 13:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.<br/>
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:<br/>
hello world! 123<br/>
Then, the output should be:<br/>
LETTERS 10 <br/>
DIGITS 3
